abstract = {There is a new standard Fortran. The official title is “American National Standard Programming Language Fortran, X3.9-1978,” but it is more commonly referred to as “Fortran 77,” since its development was completed in 1977. It replaces the Fortran standard designated X3.9-1966. This paper describes many of the features of Fortran 77 and also provides some information about how and why the standard was developed.},
