# Reducing memory utilisation of stencil-based legacy scientific code through automatic program transformation


## Background

This work is part of our efforts to automatically transform and compile legacy scientific code (in particular weather simulations and similar) in FORTAN 77 to heterogeneous platforms. The focus of this paper is on a novel program transformation to reduce the memory utilisation of stencil-based scientific code.
For scientific computations, memory requirements are often the bottleneck, both in terms of the storage and of performance. Specifically the performance of stencil codes is often limited by memory bandwidth. Reducing memory utilisation allows simulations of larger domains or with higher resolution. 
Our main observation from real-life scientific code is that many of the arrays used in typical simulation code are intermediate arrays, especially in the case of stencil computations. As anexample, consider the Large Eddy Simulator for Urban Flows \cite{}

This is a hurricane wind similator, so it simulates pressure and wind speed. Its actual inputs are the wind velocity in 3 dimensions (_u,v,w_) and the pressure (_p_), i.e. four arrays for every domain. However, the code but we actually uses 15 arrays:

    p
    u,v,w
    usum,vsum,wsum
    f,g,h
    fold,gold,hold
    sm
    rhs

In this particular case, 11 arrays are intermediate and can actually be replaced by scalar computations. If we could achieve this, the simulation could run on a 4 times larger domain with the same memory utilisation. In this paper we present a novel approach to aggressively reduce memory utilisation of stencil-based legacy scientific code through automatic program transformation.

## Related Work
- The idea is to find some similar things but be able to say that nobody has done what we have done

## Relationship to our existing work and Contribution of this work

We have developed a compilation chain which can automatically transform legacy scientific code into GPU- and FPGA- accelerated variants \cite{}. In this work we make use of this compilation chain to transform the original code into a form that can be analysed for memory reduction. In particular, the code is refactored to remove global variables (`COMMON` in Fortran) and the loops are analysed in terms of _map_ and _fold_ higher-order functions. We have shown how to transform the code into map/fold based code for GPU acceleration  \cite{}. 
Furthermore, motivated by the goal of accelerating code on FPGAs, we have developed a functional dataflow language, TyTraCL \cite{} and a source-to-source compiler which can transform the map/fold based code into this language. In this paper we start from the program in the TyTraCL language.

The contributions of the current work are 
- Additional analysis to detect stencils
- An algorithm to scalarise the kernels
- An algorithm to identify intermediate array
- A series of program transformations to remove intermediate arrays

##Â The TyTraCL language 

### TyTraCL concrete syntax

The TyTraCL language is syntactically a subset of Haskell, with the addition of two types of vectors of fixed size, similar to the vector type in Idris. Purely for convenience we also assume that `zipt`, `unzipt`, `applyt` and `elt` work on tuples of arbitrary size, as opposed to Haskell where an instance is needed for every tuple size.

#### Types

    v_i :: Vec n a
    s_i :: SVec k Int
    f_i :: a -> b

TyTraCL is a composition language, its aim is to express dataflow graphs. The actual input values and computations do not  need to be defined, so instances of the above types are ony declared.

#### Primitives 

The language has a small number of primitives, shown in Listing XXX.

    -- As in Haskell but on Vec rather than []
    map : (a -> b) -> Vec n a -> Vec n b

    -- Haskell's foldl but on Vec rather than []
    fold :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Vec n b -> a

    -- Ordinary map but only works on SVec
    maps : (a -> b) -> SVec k a -> SVec k b

    -- Every element of the vector is replaced by the stencil defined by the first argument
    stencil : SVec k Int -> Vec n a -> Vec n (SVec k a)

    -- Like Haskell's zip/unzip but takes a tuple as argument and works on Vec
    zipt :: Tup k (...,Vec n a_i,...)  -> Vec n $ Tup k (...,a_i,...)
    unzipt :: Vec n Tup k (...,a_i,...) -> Tup k (...,Vec n a_i,...)

    -- Apply a tuple of functions to a tuple of values
    applyt :: Tup k (...,a_i -> b_i,...) Tup k (...,a_i,...) -> Tup k (...,b_i,...)
    applyt (...,f_i,...) (...,e_i,...) =\(...,e_i,...) -> (...,f_i e_i,...)

    -- Generalisation of Haskell's fst/snd
    elt :: i:: Int -> (...,a_i,...) -> a_i
    elt i (...,e_i,...) = e_i

### TyTraCL Abstract Syntax

The abstract syntax for the TyTraCL language, expressed as a Haskell type, is shown in Listing XXX

        type Name = String
        data VE = VI  | VO  | VS  | VT 
            deriving (Show, Typeable, Data, Eq)            
        type TyTraCLAST = [(Expr,Expr)]                      

        data Expr =
                -- Left-hand side:
                            Scalar Name
                            | Const Int 
                            | Tuple [Expr] 
                            | Vec VE Name

                -- Right-hand side:
                            | SVec Int Name -- Stencil vector
                            | ZipT [Expr] -- generalised zip
                            | UnzipT Expr -- generalised unzip
                            | Elt Int Expr -- generalised tuple access
                            | Map Expr Expr
                            | Fold Expr Expr Expr
                            | Stencil Expr Expr
                            | Function Name [Name] -- 2nd arg is list of non-map/fold args
                            | Id
                            | ApplyT [Expr]
                            | MapS Expr Expr 
                            | Comp Expr Expr
                            | SComb Expr Expr
                                deriving (Show, Typeable, Data, Eq)

### Relationship with the original Fortan code

The typical pattern of stencil code is a sequential application of nested loops.

### Stencil detection

Array accesses are divided into read and write access.  Stencils are defined as patterns of read accesses with fixed offsets around the loop iterators. An array access pattern is a stencil if:
	- There is more than one read access to the array
	- At least one of these accesses has a non-zero offset
	- All points in the array are processed in order, i.e. the loop iterators loop over a contiguous range
Furthermore, there can only be a single write access to any array in the loop nest.

The analysis extracts the stencil pattern and transforms any stencil computation into a combination of a `stencil` call and a `map` or `fold` call. For example, 

...

becomes

        v_s = stencil s v
        v_o = map f v_s

### Scalarisation




### Intermediate array identification
### Intermediate array removal




## AST

Starting from the OpenCL Fortran code:

1. Scalarize all functions
2. Insert `stencil` calls as required
3. If a call requires a stencil of a previous call, insert a `maps` as required

Then we transform the resulting AST into a simpler AST for rewriting, see below.

## Rewrite algorithm

For every call, we look at the V_like argument first.
If it is not a vector then it must be a ZipT or a Stencil.
For a ZipT we do each arg in turn.
In principle this maybe have to be done recursively until we hit an actual Vector. For that Vector we find the assignment where it is on the LHS. Then we check the type of the RHS and the type of the parent node. As our aim is to reduce the maps, we always apply rules that aim to transform a nest call into a single map.

## Fortran-OpenCL implementation

To recreate the Fortran code from the AST, I need the signatures for the original scalarised Fortran subroutines as well as the signatures for the TyTraCL functions. And I also need signatures for the generated functions. I will then need to generate wrapper functions to go between the TyTraCL functions and the Fortran routines. Essentially, packing/unpacking of stencil tuples. A lot of this has been done in `RefactorF4Acc::Translation::LlvmToTyTraIR`

### SVec encoding

The stencil `SVec s_i_ sz "s_i"` is encoded as an array which contain the index offset tuple for each stencil point. For a paper I think making this work for 2-D arrays is fine. For every global index value, we derive `j` and `k` as usual. Then we populate the array `v_s` with the values at the points in `v` references by the stencil around `(j,k)`.

We can emit all of these from the stencil pattern info, see e.g. `RefactorF4Acc::Translation::TyTraCL::generate_TyTraCL_stencils()`.

### Stencil

Given the stencil information, we can generate the stencil as a constant array.

Example: `(SVec 2 "exp_h_1_4",Stencil (SVec 2 "s1") (Vec VI "wet_0"))`

    ! stencil
    integer, parameter, dimension(2*2) :: s1 = [...]
    real, dimension(2) :: exp_h_1_4    
    do s_idx = 0,1
      exp_h_1_4(s_idx) = v(j+s1(s_idx*2),k+s_i(s_idx*2+1))
    end do


### MapS

For any new function, I need to create the signature. I think I'd better keep the non-map/fold args separate from the function name

Example: `(Function "exp_h_1_1",MapS (SVec 2 "s5") (Function "shapiro_map_24 (eps_0,etan_avg_1)"))`

    ! maps 
    subroutine exp_h_1_1(eps_0,etan_avg_1, v_i, j,k, v_o)
        real, parameter :: s_i_sz 
        real, dimension(2*s_i_sz), parameter :: s_i = [ ...]         
        real, dimension(jm,km), intent(in) :: v_i
        real, dimension(s_i_sz), intent(out) :: v_o
        real :: u_o
        do s_idx = 0,v_s_i-1
            v_s = v_i(j+s_i(s_idx*2),k+s_i(s_idx*2+1))
            call shapiro_map_24(eps_0,etan_avg_1, v_s,u_o)
            v_o(s_idx)=u_o
        end do
    end subroutine exp_h_1_1

### ApplyT

Example: `(Function "exp_h_1_2",ApplyT [Id,Function "exp_h_1_1",Id,Id])`

ApplyT applies a tuple of functions to a tuple of values. So 

    ! applyt
    subroutine exp_h_1_2(t_i, t_o)
        real, dimension(4) :: t_i, t_o
        real :: t_o_3
        t_o(1)=t_i(1)
        t_o(2)=t_i(2)
        call exp_h_1_1(t_i(3),t_o_3)
        t_o(3)=t_o_3
        t_o(3)=t_i(4)
    end subroutine exp_h_1_2

### Comp

Example: `(Function "exp_h_1_0",Comp (PElt 0) (Function "update_map_24 (hmin_0)"))`

    ! comp
    subroutine exp_h_1_0(hzero_j_k,eta_j_k,h_j_k,hmin,un_j_k,vn_j_k, wet_j_k)        
        real, intent(in) :: hzero_j_k,eta_j_k,h_j_k,hmin,un_j_k
        real, intent(out) :: wet_j_k
        real :: u_j_k,v_j_k
        call update_map_24(hzero_j_k,eta_j_k,h_j_k,hmin,un_j_k,vn_j_k,wet_j_k,u_j_k,v_j_k)        
    end subroutine exp_h_1_2

Example: `(Function "exp_h_1_3",Comp (Function "exp_h_1_0") (Function "exp_h_1_2"))`

    ! comp
    subroutine exp_h_1_3(t_i,t_o)        
        real, intent(in) :: t_i
        real, intent(out) :: t_o
        real :: t_int        
        call exp_h_1_0(t_i, t_int)
        call exp_h_1_2(t_int,t_o)
    end subroutine exp_h_1_3



## Proofs


### Normalisation

- First we normalise so the LHS is either Vec or Scalar
- Then we remove all intermediate vectors VS VT by substitution, and also VO on the RHS

Given the AST in this form and following rules:

        map f_2 (map f_1 v) = map (f_2 . f_1) v    
        stencil s_1 (map f_1) = map (maps f_1) (stencil s_1)
        zipt (map f_1 v_1, map f_2 v_2) = map (applyt (f_1,f_2)) (zipt (v_1, v_2)) -- if all exprs in ZipT are maps
        v = map id v -- if an expr in a ZipT tuple can't be rewritten to a map expression, turn it into map using this rule
        (elt i) . unzipt . (map f v) = map ((elt i) . f) v

### Lemmas

First we prove that the rewrite rules themselves are correct. The first rule is well-known; the fourth rule is trivial. 

#### Proof for the Stencil-Map rewrite rule

    s1 : SVec k Int
    f1 : a -> b

    stencil s1 (map f1) = map (maps s1 f1) (stencil s1)

    v0 : Vec n a
    f1 : a -> b
    v1 : Vec n b

    v1s : Vec n (SVec k b)
    v1 = map f1 v0
    v1s = stencil s1 v1

    v0s : Vec (SVec k a)
    v0s = stencil s1 v0

    maps s1 f1 : SVec k a -> SVec k b
    v1s : Vec n (SVec k b)
    v1s = map (maps s1 f1) v0s

    or

    stencil s1 (map f1 v1) = map (maps s1 f1) (stencil s1 v1)

#### Proof for the ZipT-Map rewrite rule

- Given that all exprs in the tuple are map expressions
- Express the vectors in terms of their elements:

        v_i = [e_i_0, ...]
        (zipt (v_1, v_2) = [(e_1_0,e_2_0),...]

- Substitute in the LHS of the rule:

        zipt (map f_1 v_1, map f_2 v_2) = zipt ([f_1 e_1_0, f_1 e_1_1, ...], [f_2 e_2_0, f_2 e_2_1, ...])

- Apply the `map` and `zipt` definitions
        = [(f_1 e_1_0,f_2 e_2_0),(f_1 e_1_1,f_2 e_2_1),...]
- Apply the `apply` definition        
        = [
            applyt (f1,f_2) (e_1_0,e_2_0),applyt (f1,f_2) (e_1_1,e_2_1),...
        ]
- Apply the `map` definition
        = map (applyt (f1,f_2)) [(e_1_0,e_2_0),(e_1_1,e_2_1),...]
- Apply the `zipt` definition
        = map (applyt (f1,f_2)) (zipt (v_1, v_2))

#### Proof for the Elt-UnzipT-Map rewrite rule

- Given 

        f :: a -> (a_1,a_2)
        
- On the LHS, writing out with elements and applying the definition of `map`:

    map f v = [f e_0, f e_1, ...]
    = [(e_1_0, e_2_0),(e_1_1, e_2_1),...]

- Applying the definition of `unzipt`

    unzipt (map f v)
    = unzipt [(e_1_0, e_2_0),(e_1_1, e_2_1),...]
    = ([e_1_0, e_1_1,...],[e_2_0,e_2-1,...])

- Applying `elt i`, e.g. for i = 0

    (elt i) (unzipt (map f v))
    = [e_1_0, e_1_1,...]
    = v_1

- On the RHS, write the vector `v` in terms of its elements:

    v = [e_0, e_1, ... e_j, ...]

- Apply `f`:

    f e_j = (e_1_j, e_2_j)

- Apply `elt i`, e.g. for i = 0

    elt 0 (f e_l) 
    = elt 0 (e_1_j, e_2_j)
    = e_1_j

- Do this for all _j_ by applying `map`
     = [e_1_0, e_1_1, ..., e_1_j, ...]
     = v_1
   
### Theorem

Applying the rewrite rules on the normalised AST, starting from the leaf nodes, always terminates with an expression with a single map as first function.

### Proof

The proof is as follows: 

- The primitives in the language that return a `Vec` type are the vector type constructor and the functions

        map
        stencil
        zipt

- Apart from that, only the composite expression 

        (elt i) . unzipt

also returns a vector. Because of the earlier normalisation, `unzipt` will always be preceded by `(elt i)` so from the perspective of the rewrite rule this is a primitive.

Therefore, if any of these acts on a `map` expression, one of the rules will fire and result in an expression with a single map as the outer function.

- The `zipt` rule entails an extra condition that all elements of the tuple must be `map` expressions, so any elements that can't be rewritten into a `map` expressions using the other rules are turned into `map` expressions by applying a `map` over the identity function.

- If the an expression is of the form 

        map (expression without map) 
        
then none of the rules fires, so this is a fixedpoint for the rewrite system.







### What about `fold`

The purpose of the program transformations is to eliminate intermediate arrays. These occur because of the need for stencils; or they might be present in the original code.

- If an intermediate array is present in the original code, we have something like

    v1 = map f1 v0
    v2 = map f2 v1

This means that the intermediate array will automatically disappear because of the `substituteVectors` pass.

- If there is a stencil, it can either occur between a `map` and a `map` or between a `map` and a `fold`. E.g.

    v1 = map f1 v0
    v1_s = stencil s1 v1
    v2 = map f2 v1_s

or

    v1 = map f1 v0
    v1_s = stencil s1 v1
    acc2 = fold f2 acc0 v1_s

Now, after the 2nd pass this will be

    acc2 = fold f2 acc0 (stencil s1 (map f1 v0))

This will then be rewritten into     

    acc2 = fold f2 acc0 (map (maps f1) (stencil s1 v0))

          ts = case lhs of
              Tuple vecs -> split_tuple vecs rhs
              _ -> [t]
          in
              acc++ts

      split_tuple vecs rhs = let
              vecs_idxs = zip vecs [0 .. length vecs - 1]

2. Substitute all _Vec VT_ and _Vec VS_ recursively until no _Vec V_ and _Vec VS_ remain in the AST. We start from the last expression in the list. We must also substitute _Vec VO_ on the RHS but tuples with _Vec VO_ on the LHS can't be removed. Clearly, _Vec VI_ should never occur on the LHS.
3. In this AST we can start applying the rewrite rules.
4. After this we decompose the expressions in SSA/ANF style

The key question is which rules to apply, does the order matter? We need to look for patterns. As the principal aim is to replace stencils of maps, looking for stencils is a good first step.

### Repeated application of stencils


s1 = [...]
s2 = [...]

v3 = map f2 (stencil s2 (map f1 (stencil s1 v1)))


stencil s2 (map f1 (stencil s1 v1)) = map (maps s2 f1) (stencil s2 (stencil s1 v1))



v3 = map (f2 . (maps s2 f1)) (stencil s2 (stencil s1 v1))

(Stencil (SVec 3 "s2") (Stencil (SVec 3 "s1") (Vec VI "v_0"))))

stencil ::  SVec n1 -> Vec a -> Vec (SVec n1 a)

stencil ::  SVec n1 -> Vec (SVec n2 a) -> Vec (SVec n1 (SVec n2 a))


(Stencil (SVec 3 "s2") (Stencil (SVec 3 "s1") (Vec VI "v_0"))))

(Stencil (SComb (SVec 3 "s2") (SVec 3 "s1")) (Vec VI "v_0"))))

the first stencil generates [v@off1, v@off2, v@off3, ...]

the second stencil generates [[], []]



    ! stencil
    integer, parameter, dimension(2*2) :: s1 = [...]
    real, dimension(2) :: exp_h_1_4    
    do s_idx = 0,1
      exp_h_1_4(s_idx) = v(j+s1(s_idx*2),k+s_i(s_idx*2+1))
    end do
